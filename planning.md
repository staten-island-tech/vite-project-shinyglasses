- CSS Custom Properties, Arrays, Objects and ViteJS.
- feeding child
- if hungry it gets mad 
- if no interact (by not playing games?? petting) -> sad 
- different status effects - hungry, sad, angry 
     - -> passive aggressive messages??? pet changes color? background changes color? you are overcome with shame and your stats decrease?
     - maybe have a feature where you can discipline the pet for rebelling?? time out??? 
     - if not fed within a certain amount of time, more hungry (same idea for playing and sadness)
     - if neglect pet for too long, it REBELS and then "runs away" maybe a chase scene where you need to get the wayward pet "COME BACK!!!"
- dark and light mode (maybe AN ANGRY dark and light mode if you neglect the pet??)
- save files - store the pet data + default color scheme in local storage

to do 
- media query !!! priority 
- if multiple pets die in quick succession do 'oh no x amount of pets have died'
- BEFORE BRINGING TO NETLIFY CHANGE THE HUNGER INTERVAL !!!!!!prirority
- every xyz sec, save the stats of the pets to saves
- can condense the css -> give nav bar pop ups their own class, same for error and death message pop ups
- primary button css -> basically only for the buy btn
- fix my weird css classes -> i tried to follow bem but there's some classes w/ only 1 _ instead of 2
